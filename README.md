# Lightyear Frontier Desktop

*Keep the homestead on disk before a frontier patch.*

## Overview

**Lightyear Frontier Desktop** runs on your own PC. A local helper for Lightyear Frontier homestead folders, mech notes, and valley photos.

Mech-farm saves sit next to Steam clouds.

Files stay on the machine that runs the tool. Originals are left alone unless you choose otherwise.

## Editions

Use the command-line copy in this repository if you already have Python.

If you want a normal installer for Windows or macOS, open the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8) and follow the steps there.

## What it does

- Finds the Lightyear Frontier folder.
- Copies homestead and mech files.
- Lists valley photo albums.
- Writes a short keep report.

## Environment

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Run locally

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```text
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
